# fasttext_java
Java port of [c++ facebook fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) 
and fork of [ivanhk fastText_java port](https://github.com/ivanhk/fastText_java).

The main differences with the original port (proposed):
* up-to-date version of c++ fastext
* supports any kind of I/O streams (including hadoop)
* tests
* java8
* correct java coding style and good OOP model
